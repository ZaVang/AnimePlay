Michiko rescues Hana from her abusive foster parents and claims to know her father, who, according to her, was a good man and \"made her fall in love with him right away\". Both she and Hana embark on a journey to find him while on the run from the law as well. They become a bickering pair, but soon come to realize how much they truly need each other.",
